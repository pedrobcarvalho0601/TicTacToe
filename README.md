# TicTacToe
This was my first university project: a tic-tac-toe game with a scoring system and memory of the previous game (meaning that if you exit mid-game, you can still resume the match).

It includes difficulty level options for the bots as well as different game modes.
The level 4 bot was implemented using the Minimax algorithm.
